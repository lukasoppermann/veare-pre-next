      <p class="o-copy o-copy--big">Interaction design combines interface, motion & user experience design. It is the <em>“how”</em> of bringing information to the user, considering product strategy and business objectives.</p>

      <p class="o-copy o-copy--big">Every medium has different limitations and opportunities. I focus on emphaszing the good, like motion in digital products or haptics in physical ones.</p>
